# smaiso-wcomp
The smaiso-wcomp code was developed for studying the evolution of an interface between a smectic-A liquid crystal and an isotropic phase (e.g. liquid crystalline phase, water, air), both displaying different densities. The smectic layering is represented by an order parameter \psi and the system is weakly compressible, so that the density is an independent variable The present file contain an implementation of the model proposed in:
